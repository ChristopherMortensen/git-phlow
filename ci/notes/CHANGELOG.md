The release brings much needed features to the phlow. Requests for opening GitHub issues in your browser have been heard, and here it is.
We have also tried to address the issues with the workon command, where in some cases it was unable to locate the issues on github.
As always we strive for perfection and try to make the code pretty as a butterfly.
git-phlow can still not keep the coffey hot, but we are working hard on it.
