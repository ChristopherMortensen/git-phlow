The release brings some much needed features to the phlow. Requests for opening GitHub issues have been heard, and here it is.
We have also tried to address the issues with the workon command, where in some cases it was unable to locate the issues on github.
As always we strive for perfection and try to make the code pretty as a butterfly.
