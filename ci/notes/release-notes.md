This release brings git-phlow in a stable version. You can now use the workflow and authenticate with github, so we get the issue-tracking sweetness we all so desperately want. All commands from the beta version are now stable; and for interested developers we have also done some code cleanup to spare your eyes. 
The documentation have also been improved so the commands are more descriptive. 

Features
- phlow commands (workon, wrapup, deliver, mkalias) - in a stable version
- github issue tracking
- auth (authenticate with github)
- updated documentation
